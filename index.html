        Since many uses of programming involve making multiple elements with similar properties, it helps to use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
      </p>
      <p>
        As it's name suggests, OOP makes use of <b>objects</b>, which are elements which have both <b>state</b> (variables of data which apply to it) and <b>behavior</b> (functions/methods which can be called upon and applied to it). The simplest and most common way to create them is with <b>classes</b>, which directly describe the state and behavior of objects which apply to it. They use <b>instance variables</b> to describe the state and <b>instance methods</b> to describe  the behavior. Objects created from a class are referred to as individual <b>instances</b> of that class.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not every class uses both instance variables <i>and</i> instance methods, but every one uses the <b>self</b> variable and the "_init_" method. When initially created, the _init_ method partitions necessary memory in the computer. The self variable is how the instance refers to itself. This becomes especially useful for larger prjects where multiple of the same type of object are required, because variable names can be assigned to the different instances, which will then be applied to the instance itself via the self variable.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is all done very similarly to how CSS function...they even use the same name; classes. In CSS, a class is written to describe how certain elements should look, then elements which are designated as being part of that class take on those characteristics. In OOP, a class is written which describes <i>what</i> its instances are and how they function. In both cases, the casses help to define the elements. The main difference between them, however, is that OOP instances must belong to <i>exactly</i> one class to make any kind of sense, whereas a normal element doesn't <i>necessarily</i> need to belong to any CSS class and can, in fact, belong to several.
      </p>
      <p>
        When using OOP, the class is generally written either at the beginning of the code or, more commonly, on a separate piece of code that's saved within the same folder. In the case of the latter, you have to import the class into your code in the same way
        you would things from the Python Standard Library (PSL); like <i>twilio</i> or <i>webbrowser</i>. A <b>library</b> is essentially a list of available pre-written classes for you to use. PSL comes pre-loaded with most Python software, can be readily accessed. Other classes however, like <i>twilio</i> or <i>fresh tomatoes</i>, must be sepearately downloaded onto your computer before using.
